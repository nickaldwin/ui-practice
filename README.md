# ui-practice

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**<br>
<br>
`gulp`  `gulp-sass` `gulp-postcss` `sass`



## Optimizations

I didn't have time to fully design out the app on the front end so that would be the biggest optimization to elevate this project. Another great optimization planned for the future is to allow user to do what Instagram doesn't: edit posts and comments. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project really helped me solidify my skills on `Front-end`
