## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** `gulp`  `gulp-sass` `gulp-postcss` `sass`

This app allows users to make an account and upload posts with pictures, look at a feed of all user posts, comments on posts, and view user profiles. I used EJS to apply my HTML and Tailwind for the CSS to for the front-end. I used JS for some conditional features like allowing the original poster to delete their comments and/or posts. Node was used to craft the server and all information is stored on MongoDB. Passwords are hashed before storing i put comments in individual folders. 



## Optimizations

I didn't have time to fully design out the app on the front end so that would be the biggest optimization to elevate this project. Another great optimization planned for the future is to allow user to do what Instagram doesn't: edit posts and comments. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project really helped me solidify my skills on `Front-end`
